# Challenge 2

> "Then, Francesco tells you that the expert providing him with the stone valuations disappeared. **He wants you to develop a model to predict the value of a new diamond given its characteristics**. He insists on a point: his customer are not easy-going, so he wants to know why a stone is given a certain value. Create a Jupyter notebook to meet Francesco's request."

In this folder the jupyter notebook `main.ipynb` can be found addressing the challenge. It runs in a virtual environment with `requirements.txt` installed (one can alternatively run it in google colab by correctly pointing the text files the notebook reads).
