# Challenge 1

> "**Francesco wants to know which factors influence the value of a diamond**: he is not an expert, he wants simple and clear messages. However, he trusts no one, and he hired another data scientist to get a second opinion on your work. Create a Jupyter notebook to explain what Francesco should look at and why. Your code should be understandable by a data scientist, but your text should be clear for a layman."

In this folder the jupyter notebook `main.ipynb` can be found addressing the challenge. It runs in a virtual environment with `requirements.txt` installed (one can alternatively run it in google colab by correctly pointing the text files the notebook reads).
